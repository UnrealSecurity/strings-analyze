# Strings Analyze

- Strings Analyze is a tool for Windows to analyze string dumps from process' memory or executable files.
I use this tool with **strings2** from http://split-code.com/strings2.html

- You'll need to get the patterns from [strings-analyze-patterns](https://github.com/UnrealSecurity/strings-analyze-patterns) and place the folder **Patterns** in the same folder with **Strings Analyze**.
